# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description

I refactored the website to better provide accessibility from ensuring the text is organized in a way that is easily readable. I also made sure the side block could line up to be beside the other cards in the main body. I learned more about positioning objects on a website more properly. 

## Usage

These are screenshots of the webpage that is arrange for computer screens. The nav buttons on the top 
blue box can be clicked to navigate to the boxes below and on the side.
